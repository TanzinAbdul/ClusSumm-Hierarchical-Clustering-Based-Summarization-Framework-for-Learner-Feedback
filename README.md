# ClusSumm: Hierarchical Clustering-Based Summarization Framework for Learner Feedback

## Overview
Online learning platforms have revolutionized access to cation globally, but extracting meaningful insights from vast and diverse learner reviews remains a significant challenge. This repository introduces **ClusSumm**, a novel hierarchical clustering-based summarization framework designed to efficiently summarize learner feedback across various domains, including AI, Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, and Web Development. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, ClusSumm transforms unstructured learner feedback into actionable insights, enabling online cation platforms to refine course offerings and enhance user experience.

## Key Features
- **Domain-Specific Summarization**: Focuses on summarizing learner feedback in specialized domains such as AI, Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, and Web Development.
- **Advanced NLP Models**: Evaluates state-of-the-art summarization models, including BART, T5, PEGASUS, and FLAN-T5, based on ROUGE score optimization.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Introduces a novel hierarchical clustering-based framework to filter and organize learner reviews effectively.
- **Adaptive Summarization**: Applies adaptive summarization techniques to enhance coherence and informativeness while maintaining brevity.
- **High Summarization Efficiency**: Achieves a summarization ratio of 12.65%, outperforming conventional models by preserving key insights without excessive rndancy.
